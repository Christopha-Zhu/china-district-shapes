This repository contains a Jupyter notebook, in which I used Hu moment invariants to find administrative divisions in China that have similar shapes as China itself. The shapes of the administrative division are taken from [Gaode Maps API](https://lbs.amap.com/). For more information, please refer to [the corresponding question on Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/question/52953107/answer/483920015).
